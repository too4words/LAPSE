LAPSE is designed to help with the task of auditing Java J2EE applications for common types of security vulnerabilities found in Web applications. LAPSE was developed by Benjamin Livshits as part of the Griffin Software Security Project.\r\n\r\nLAPSE targets the following Web application vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n* Parameter manipulation\r\n* Header manipulation\r\n* Cookie poisoning\r\n* Command-line parameters\r\n* SQL injections\r\n* Cross-site scripting\r\n* HTTP splitting\r\n* Path traversal\r\n\r\nWhat should you do to avoid these vulnerabilities in your code? How do we protect Web applications from exploits? The proper way to deal with these types of attacks is by sanitizing the tainted input. Please refer to the OWASP guide to find out more about Web application security.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in auditing a Java Web application, LAPSE helps you in the following ways:\r\n\r\n* Identify taint sources\r\n* Identify taint sinks\r\n* Find paths between sources and sinks\r\n\r\nLAPSE is inspired by existing lightweight security auditing tools such as RATS, pscan, and FlawFinder. Unlike those tools, however, LAPSE addresses vulnerabilities in Web applications. \r\n\r\nLAPSE is *not* intended as a comprehensive solution for Web application security, but rather as an aid in the code review process. Those looking for more comprehensive tools are encouraged to either read our Usenix Security '05 paper or to look at some of the tools produced by Fortify or Secure Software.\r\n\r\n### Research Publications Related to LAPSE ###\r\n\r\n### Download ###\r\nVersion 2.7.0 of LAPSE is available for download. This plugin is compatible with Eclipse 3.3.1 and requires Java 1.5 or later to run properly. Older versions of the plugin work with Eclipse 3.2. It will not work with Eclipse 3.1 or earlier. After you download the plugin, extract it into the plugins directory of your Eclipse distribution. Make sure you delete any previous versions of LAPSE you might have. If you are having trouble, check out the FAQs to see if your question is answered.\r\n\r\nLAPSE and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) which accompanies this distribution, and is available at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html.
